      <description>This post is based on a talk I gave to my research group at Cambridge University in June 2024. You can find the notes and slides for the talk here.
Solutions to most problems aren’t particularly useful. Solutions to a small number of problems are extremely useful. If you’re interested in doing good, you’ll want to search for problems that look like the latter. It’s a hard search, but the ROI is likely greater than any other use of your time, and I have some ways of running it that I think make it a little more tractable.</description>
