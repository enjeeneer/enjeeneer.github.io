      <description>This post is based on a talk I gave to my research group at Cambridge University in June 2024. You can find the notes and slides for the talk here.
Solutions to most problems aren’t particularly useful. Solutions to a small number of problems are extremely useful. If you’re interested in doing good, you’ll want to search for problems that look like the latter. It’s a hard search, but the ROI is likely greater than any other use of your time, and I have some ways of running it that I think make it a little more tractable.</description>

What are problems?  “A problem is a situation in which we experience conflicting ideas.”
David Deutsch
 Let’s start with a definition, here’s the best I’ve found for what constitutes a problem. David Deutsch says a problem is a situation in which we experience conflicting ideas. In other words we have two or more explanations about how we might proceed, and it&amp;rsquo;s not initially clear how to choose between them.</description>

 Summary Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn general policies that can, in principle, solve any unseen task in an environment. Recently, methods leveraging successor features and successor measures have emerged as viable zero-shot RL candidates, returning near-optimal policies for many unseen tasks. However, to enable this, they have assumed access to unrealistically large and heterogeneous datasets of transitions for pre-training.</description>

      <description>I was fortunate to attend NeurIPS in New Orleans in November. Here, I publish my takeaways to give you a feel for the zeitgeist. I’ll discuss, firstly, the papers, then the workshops, and finally, and briefly, the keynotes.
Papers Here’s a ranked list of my top 8 papers. Most are on Offline RL, which is representative of the conference writ large.

      <description>Abstract
Heating and cooling systems in buildings account for 31% of global energy use, much of which are regulated by Rule Based Controllers (RBCs) that neither maximise energy efficiency nor minimise emissions by interacting optimally with the grid. Control via Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to significantly improve building energy efficiency, but existing solutions require pre-training in simulators that are prohibitively expensive to obtain for every building in the world.</description>

      <description>An Introduction to Reinforcement Learning Tom Bewley &amp;amp; Scott Jeen Alan Turing Institute 24/02/2022 The best way to walk through this tutorial is using the accompanying Jupyter Notebook:

1 | Markov Decision Processes: A Model of Sequential Decision Making 1.1. MDP (semi-)Formalism In reinforcement learning (RL), an agent takes actions in an environment to change its state over discrete timesteps $t$, with the goal of maximising the future sum of a scalar quantity known as reward.</description>

[Jupyter Notebook]
- In the last year I&amp;rsquo;ve started presenting work using Jupyter Notebooks, rebelling against the Bill Gates&#39;-driven status-quo. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to do it. It&amp;rsquo;s not difficult, but in my opinion makes presentations look slicker, whilst allowing you to run code live in a presentation if you like. First, we need to download the plug-in that gives us the presentation functionality, it&amp;rsquo;s called RISE.</description>
